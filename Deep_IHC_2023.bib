abstract = {Background: Periodontitis has been associated with several systemic diseases and medical conditions, including oral cancer (OC). However, most studies reporting an association between OC and periodontal disease have used different clinical and radiographic criteria to define periodontal disease. This review aimed to evaluate the currently available evidence to determine an association between periodontal disease (extension and severity), OC, and oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMDs). Material and methods: A systematic search of studies published up to August 2018 was performed following the PRISMA guidelines in the electronic databases MEDLINE (PubMed) and COCHRANE (OVID). A methodological evaluation was made using the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) checklist. Results: Eight studies (case-control, cross-sectional and cohort) were included. An increased clinical attachment loss, plaque index, bleeding on probing, and radiographic bone loss was found in patients with OC and OPMDs. Differences in the methodological characteristics, case definition used for periodontal diseases, and OC location did not allow estimating the odds ratio required to conduct a meta-analysis. Conclusion: Some studies suggest a positive relationship between periodontal disease, OC, and OPMDs; however, the currently available evidence is insufficient to draw solid conclusions.

abstract = {Aim: Periodontal disease encompasses gingivitis and periodontitis, which exerts systemic effects. We conducted a population-based study to evaluate the association between periodontal disease and the risk of cancer. Methods: We used insurance claims data from 1997 to 2010, accessing a database of 1 million randomly selected insurants in Taiwan. All patients were older than 20 and newly diagnosed with periodontitis between 1 January 1997 and 31 December 2010. The comparison cohort comprised patients older than 20, who were newly diagnosed with gingivitis in the same period. Both cohorts were followed until a cancer diagnosis, lost to follow-up, death, termination of insurance, or the end of 2010. Results: The incidence rate of cancer was 1.14 times higher in the study cohort than in the comparison cohort [confidence interval (CI) = 1.11-1.17]. The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) was 1.05 (95{\%} CI = 1.00-1.11). A multivariable analysis showed that the periodontitis patients exhibited an elevated risk of developing oral cancer (adjusted HR = 1.79, 95{\%} CI = 1.42-2.25). Conclusion: The findings indicated that patients in the periodontitis cohort exhibited a higher risk of developing oral cancer than those in the gingivitis cohort.},

abstract = {Early identification and management of precancerous lesions at high risk of developing cancers is the most effective and economical way to reduce the incidence, mortality, and morbidity of cancers as well as minimizing treatment-related complications, including pain, impaired functions, and disfiguration. Reliable cancer-risk-predictive markers play an important role in enabling evidence-based decision making as well as providing mechanistic insight into the malignant conversion of precancerous lesions. The focus of this article is to review updates on markers that may predict the risk of oral premalignant lesions (OPLs) in developing into oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCCs), which can logically be discovered only by prospective or retrospective longitudinal studies that analyze pre-progression OPL samples with long-term follow-up outcomes. These risk-predictive markers are different from those that prognosticate the survival outcome of cancers after they have been diagnosed and treated, or those that differentiate between different lesion types and stages. Up-to-date knowledge on cancer-risk-predictive markers discovered by longitudinally followed studies will be reviewed. The goal of this endeavor is to use this information as a starting point to address some key challenges limiting our progress in this area in the hope of achieving effective translation of research discoveries into new clinical interventions.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Oral potentially malignant disorders harbour variable and  unpredictable risk for squamous carcinoma development. Whilst current management strategies utilise histopathological diagnoses, dysplasia grading and targeted intervention for "high-risk" lesions, clinicians are unable to predict malignant potential. METHODS: Detailed, retrospective clinico-pathological analysis of potentially malignant lesions undergoing malignant transformation, from a 590 patient cohort treated by interventional laser surgery and followed for a mean of 7.3 years, was undertaken. Clinical outcome was documented at study census date (31 December 2014). RESULTS: A total of 99 patients (16.8{\%}) developed cancer: 71 (12{\%}) seen "unexpectedly" upon excision and 28 (4.8{\%}) progressing to malignancy at a median of 87.3 months post-surgery. Thirty "unexpected" excisions were micro-invasive (42.3{\%}) arising primarily in severely dysplastic precursors (75{\%}) at ventro-lateral tongue and floor of mouth sites (54.5{\%}); 1 patient (1.4{\%}) had a cancer-related death, whilst 58 (81.7{\%}) were disease free. A total of 19 of 28 "progressive" cancers (67.9{\%}) arose at new sites, with erythroleukoplakia a significant predictor of malignancy (P = .0019). Nine (32.1{\%}) developed at the same precursor site, with 6 (77.7{\%}) on the ventro-lateral tongue and floor of mouth. Three (10.7{\%}) were micro-invasive, 9 patients (32.1{\%}) died from metastatic disease and 12 (42.9{\%}) were disease free (P {\textless} .001). CONCLUSION: Squamous carcinoma may arise at the site of a precursor lesion as transformation or new-site development via field cancerisation. Whilst interventional surgery facilitates early diagnosis and treatment of occult disease, thus reducing risk from same-site transformation, new-site cancer is a significant long-term risk for patients with potentially malignant disorder.},

abstract = {Much of biomedical research is observational. The reporting of such research is often inadequate, which hampers the assessment of its strengths and weaknesses and of a study's generalizability. The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) Initiative developed recommendations on what should be included in an accurate and complete report of an observational study. We defined the scope of the recommendations to cover three main study designs: cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional studies. We convened a 2-day workshop in September 2004, with methodologists, researchers, and journal editors to draft a checklist of items. This list was subsequently revised during several meetings of the coordinating group and in e-mail discussions with the larger group of STROBE contributors, taking into account empirical evidence and methodological considerations. The workshop and the subsequent iterative process of consultation and revision resulted in a checklist of 22 items (the STROBE Statement) that relate to the title, abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections of articles. Eighteen items are common to all three study designs and four are specific for cohort, case-control, or cross-sectional studies. A detailed Explanation and Elaboration document is published separately and is freely available on the web sites of PLoS Medicine, Annals of Internal Medicine, and Epidemiology. We hope that the STROBE Statement will contribute to improving the quality of reporting of observational studies.},

abstract = {After more than a decade, the World Health Organization (WHO) published the  revised grading system for oral epithelial dysplasia in 2017. The revised classification has changes reflecting our evolution of understanding of the dysplastic process. Although the WHO 2017 three-tier grading system is the gold standard for histological diagnosis of oral potentially malignant disorders, it has certain limitations. Suggestions to overcome these limitations include the use of clinical determinants and molecular markers to supplement the grading system. It has also been suggested that a two-tier system may be more reproducible and clinically translatable for better management. These advances in the understanding of epithelial dysplasia are very important globally and for us in the Indian subcontinent, given the prevalence of habits (tobacco/areca nut) and burden of oral cancer in this part of the world.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Total P16 methylation (P16M), including P16 hydroxymethylation (P16H)  and true-P16M, correlates with malignant transformation of oral epithelial dysplasia (OED). Both true-P16M and P16H are early events in carcinogenesis. The aim of this study is to prospectively determine if discrimination of true-P16M from P16H is necessary for prediction of cancer development from OEDs. METHODS: Patients (n = 265) with mild or moderate OED were recruited into the double blind two-center cohort. Total-P16M and P16H were analyzed using the 115-bp MethyLight, TET-assisted bisulfite (TAB) methylation-specific PCR (MSP), and TAB-sequencing. Total-P16M-positive and P16H-negative samples were defined as true-P16M-positive. Progression of OEDs was monitored for a minimum 24 months follow-up period. RESULTS: P16H was detected in 23 of 73 (31.5{\%}) total-P16M-positive OEDs. Follow-up information was obtained from 247 patients with an ultimate compliance rate of 93.2{\%}. OED-derived squamous cell carcinomas were observed in 13.0{\%} (32/247) patients during follow-up (median, 41.0 months). The cancer progression rate for total-P16M-positive patients was significantly increased when compared to total-P16M-negative patients [23.3{\%} vs 8.6{\%}; adjusted odds ratio = 2.67 (95{\%} CI: 1.19-5.99)]. However, the cancer progression rates were similar between P16H- and true-P16M-positive OEDs [26.1{\%} (6/23) vs 22.0{\%} (11/50); odds ratio = 0.80 (95{\%} CI: 0.22-2.92)]. The cancer-free survival was also similar for these patients. CONCLUSION: P16H and true-P16M are similar biomarkers for determining malignant potential of OEDs. Discrimination of P16H from true-P16M, at least in OED, may be not necessary in clinical applications.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is one of the major causes of mortality globally. Therefore, different Machine Learning (ML) techniques were deployed for computing survival and diagnosis. Survival analysis methods are used to compute survival probability and the most important factors affecting that probability. Most survival analysis methods are used to deal with clinical features (up to hundreds), hence applying survival analysis methods like cox regression on RNAseq microarray data with many features (up to thousands) is considered a major challenge. METHODS: In this paper, a novel approach applying autoencoder to reduce the number of features is proposed. Our approach works on features reconstruction, and removal of noise within the data and features with zero variance across the samples, which facilitates extraction of features with the highest variances (across the samples) that most influence the survival probabilities. Then, it estimates the survival probability for each patient by applying random survival forests and cox regression. Applying the autoencoder on thousands of features takes a long time, thus our model is applied to the Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) in order to speed up the process. Finally, the model is evaluated and compared with the existing models on three different datasets in terms of run time, concordance index, and calibration curve, and the most related genes to survival are discovered. Finally, the biological pathways and GO molecular functions are analyzed for these significant genes. RESULTS: We fine-tuned our autoencoder model on RNA-seq data of three datasets to train the weights in our survival prediction model, then using different samples in each dataset for testing the model. The results show that the proposed AutoCox and AutoRandom algorithms based on our feature selection autoencoder approach have better concordance index results comparing the most recent deep learning approaches when applied to each dataset. Each gene resulting from our autoencoder model weight is computed. The weights show the degree of effect for each gene upon the survival probability. For instance, four of the most survival-related experimentally validated genes are on the top of our discovered genes weights list, including PTPRG, MYST1, BG683264, and AK094562 for the breast cancer gene expression dataset. Our approach improves the survival analysis in terms of speeding up the process, enhancing the prediction accuracy, and reducing the error rate in the estimated survival probability.},

abstract = {Background: Silencing of P16 through methylation and locus deletion is the most frequent early events in carcinogenesis. The aim of this study is to prospectively determine if early P16 methylation is a predictor for oral cancer development. Methods: Patients (n = 181) with mild or moderate oral epithelial dysplasia (OED) were recruited into the double blind multicentre cohort. P16 methylation was analyzed using the MethyLight assay. Progression of OEDs was monitored for a minimum 3. year follow-up period. Findings: P16 methylation-informative cases (n = 152) were enrolled in the prospective multicenter cohorts with an ultimate compliance of 96.7{\%}. OED-derived squamous cell carcinomas were observed in 21 patients (14.3{\%}) during the follow-up (median, 41.0 months). The cancer progression rate from the P16 methylation-positive patients was significantly increased when compared to P16 methylation-negative patients [27.1{\%} vs 8.1{\%}; adjusted odds ratio = 4.6; P = 0.006]. When the P16 methylation-positive criteria were used as a biomarker for early prediction of cancer development from OEDs, sensitivity and specificity of 62{\%} and 76{\%} were obtained, respectively.

Study Design
181 patients with mild or moderate OED were selected from cases of oral leukoplakia, lichen planus, or chronic discoid erythematosus at Peking University School of Stomatology (Central-A, n = 82), Capital Medical University School of Stomatology (Central-B, n = 68), and Fourth Military Medical University Hospital of Stomatology (Central-C, n = 31) between 2009 and 2011. The biopsy specimens were fixed in neutral buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, and stained with H{\&}E. The baseline OED lesions were classified as mild, moderate, or severe by at least two senior pathologists using the same criteria from the 2005 WHO Classification System (
Gale et al., 2005). The sample size was calculated according to results of our previous single center study (
Cao et al., 2009).
All cases involved primary lesions with no prior surgical, LASER, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy treatments. Information on clinical variables, lesion site, cigarette smoking, alcohol use, and past medical history was also collected. Follow-up examination was regularly performed every three months in a double-blind pattern for at least three years as described previously (
Cao et al., 2009). If malignant development was observed, an additional examination and re-biopsy were carried out. Patients who did not require a re-biopsy during the follow-up examination period due to an obvious disappearance/regression of the baseline lesion continued to undergo extensive examinations (Fig. 1). The study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the Peking University Cancer Hospital, and all patients gave written informed consent. This trial is registered in the U.S. National Institutes of Health Clinical Trials Protocol Registration System in accordance with the criteria outlined by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (trial number NCT01695018, available at http://ClinicalTrials.gov).},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Inactivation of p16 gene by CpG methylation is a frequent event in oral epithelial dysplasia. To investigate the predictive value of p16 methylation on malignant potential in oral epithelial dysplasia, we carried out the prospective cohort study. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: One hundred one patients with histologically confirmed mild or moderate oral epithelial dysplasia were included in the present cohort study. p16 Methylation status of the oral epithelial dysplasia lesions from 93 cases was obtained by methylation-specific PCR. Progression of the oral epithelial dysplasia lesions was examined in 78 cases histologically during a 45.8 months follow-up period. The association between p16 methylation and progression of oral epithelial dysplasia was analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 93 enrolled cases, 15 cases were lost during the follow-up because of changes of contact information, with a compliance of 83.9{\%}. p16 Methylation was detectable in oral epithelial dysplasia lesions from 32 (41.0{\%}) of 78 enrolled patients. Oral epithelial dysplasia-related squamous cell carcinomas were observed in 22 patients (28.2{\%}) during the follow-up. Rate of progression to oral cancer in patients with the p16-methylated oral epithelial dysplasia was significantly higher than that with the p16-unmethylated oral epithelial dysplasia (43.8{\%} versus 17.4{\%}; adjusted odds ratio, 3.7; P = 0.013), especially for patients at the baseline age of {\textgreater} or = 60 years (adjusted odds ratio, 12.0; P = 0.003) and patients with moderate oral epithelial dysplasia (adjusted odds ratio, 15.6; P = 0.022). The overall sensitivity and specificity of prediction of malignant transformation of oral epithelial dysplasia by p16 methylation were 63.6{\%} and 67.9{\%}, respectively. CONCLUSION: p16 Methylation was correlated with malignant transformation of oral epithelial dysplasia and is a potential biomarker for prediction of prognosis of mild or moderate oral epithelial dysplasia.},
